# CPR Card Template Creator

This is a GUI applicaiton using QT and Python. The application is used for training purposes when hosting training classes 
in First Aid and CPR. 

To provide the students with CPR cards showing their completion, you must create a tedious Word document 
for each student and print it out on the blank CPR card. To streamline this process I created this application that will both 
create the card templates for an entire class, it will also persist this data using sqlite3 on the backend so you may always 
find old students and reissue then lost/damaged cards.
